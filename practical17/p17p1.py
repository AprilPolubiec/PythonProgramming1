# Two suggested optimisations for the algorithm to calculate the divisors of a number
# are to initalise the divisors tuple to include 1 and the number itself and to only
# search from 2 and as far as half of the number.
# Revise the solution on Pages 14â€“17 of the slides to include these optimisations.
