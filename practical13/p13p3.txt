What happens...

(a) If you include the line print(print_max())?
The function will still print "The largest of 4.0 and 6.0 is 6.0" but then there will be another line which prints out "None".
This is because the outer print() is printing the return value of print_max() which is None because we return nothing.

(b) If you omit the brackets after print_max(), ie just have print_max? 
Nothing happens because you are not invoking the function, you are just stating it.

(c) If you include the line print(print_max)?
It prints out information about the print_max function, in other words, it's type and its address.
<function print_max at 0x10038d120>
